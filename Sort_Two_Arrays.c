You must implement the function sortTwoArrays. The function accepts two integer arrays of size M and N. The funciton must sort the arrays in descending order and store the largest M integers of both arrays in the first array and the remaining N integers in the second array. The final values in the arrays must also be sorted in descending order.
Note: Modify the arrays and do not print anything in the function.

Example Input/Output 1:
Input:
3 4
2 6 12
1 4 13 8

Output:
Array1: 13 12 8
Array2: 6 4 2 1

Explanation:
The size of the array1 is 3 so the largest 3 integers are sorted in descending and stored in array1.
The remaining integers are stored in array2 in desceding order.
